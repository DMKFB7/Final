### What I value Most
The thing I value most in life is my family. No matter what struggles or hardships I go through my family is right by my side on everything. Me and my family take trips every year and then have one big family reunion in Branson Missouri in July every year.
I have family here and from Texas that drive up
The event will usually go on for a week and 40 of us the day we're leaving take a picture each year to see how we grow every year.
