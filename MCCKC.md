## MCCKC
**Metropolitan Community College or Longview** is about 5 minutes away from where I live and the expierience I had there was not well. Don't get me wrong for a first year in college it was a good stepping stone for me grades wise and learning how to study for things.
The bad part of it was that for my first year expierience wise was not fun. The atmosphere and the body language people would give out would make the campus depressing and bland. 
The teachers there however did their part on having you succeed. 
## *Why Longview*
I was forced to go to longview my first year because my parents wanted me to get a feel of what college course work was like.
