## Why I changed my major!
Throughout highschool I always wanted to be an engineer. I went from many different fields such as industrial, aeronautical, nd mechanical.
My senior year of highschool I wasn't sure exactly what to do. My entire life I wanted to do this field and I realized that with all the work I did in the long run I didn't think I would enjoy it.
So I decided to do business but I didn't know what minor I wanted so when coming to Mizzou I applied to do computer engineering with a minor in business.
